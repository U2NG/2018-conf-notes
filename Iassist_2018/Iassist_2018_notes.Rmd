Abstract
Data Journalism: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Data Science and Storytelling

Data journalism is the marriage of social science and public-interest storytelling, using data as a source and employing reproducible analysis methods to arrive at a conclusion. This is a radical change from traditional ways of reporting, which often rely on anecdotes and paper documents. But despite being at its heart journalism, where crafting a gripping narrative is just as important as getting the facts right, data journalists haven't always been good at telling stories. This is changing, and we're entering a golden age of storytelling based on data and stats.

data storytellers
data journalism - 
data analysis for presentation - target audience for all 
need to present clear for everyone
e.g. looking at census data
developing narrative for data analysis and visualization 
uses data to find information about Canadians, e.g. analysis and viz kickstarter projects 

complex data - car sharing e.g. car to go 
mapping car 2 go data to see if parking cars take up residential spaces by car2go cars
exposed urban planning probs and transportation issues 

site created provides info for fatal encounters by police in canada 
created database victims by police 

ML example - buzzfeed US spy planes flying over cities - using public flight data records 

ProPublica - Machine bias project predicting reoffending criminals - data profiling black men. because of overrepresentation of data , e.g. watchdog technology 

data journalism - data analysis for developing stories 

computer assisted reporting - old term for data journalism
software improvements 
push for gov to release data - e.g. montreal open data advocacy groups portail donnees , quebec (open quebec) Open North gov data effort 

NICAR - nat. institute compute assisted reporting 

big graphics - make the user figure out the story 
communicate clearly and honestly - create the story 

e.g. jeff bezo banning powerpoints 
data scientists = storytellig

freytag's dramatic arch for storytelling 

e.g. pinellas county - tampa bay times
uses freytag arch for storytelling

state of gun violence video - use of data for storytelling youtube
make the reader a character in the story - e.g. uber driver example 

e.g. the globe and mail - police dismiss sexual assault claims - story written using data

NC jail inmates death poor supervision from jail
man gives out most parking tickets in boston - char study using data



# Road Maps for RDM Services, What Next?
#### Session Chair: Rachel Walton, Rollins College

### Scaling up RDM services at Duke University: Where we are now, what we have learned, and where we are going
#### Jennifer Darragh; Sophia Lafferty-Hess

looking at teams specifically for the repository development 
worked with liaison librarians - for presenting services to the greater community 

launched services in 2017 

RDM education: dev 12 unique workshops 
wroked with deam of academic affiars for grads - developed program all grads required to take 6 hours for credit 
challenge content cannot cover all disciplines
workshops e.g.
IRB
Research computing 

life cycle based services: based on environmental scanning
DMPs 
active project workflow management 
preservation and access services 

challenges:
distributed collaborative research - uses OSF for collaborative project solution 


repo services: 
moving to Fedora
preingest reveiw of data files 
streamlined deposit process - pre ingest process included 

what works:
DOis 
pre-publication review 
apply FAIR standards 
connections and collaborations with groups on campus e.g. events for DMP reviews DMPTool 
Data management education important - hearing about tools to use , challenge - don't know if practices are being followed 

marketing services continuously...

future processes:
increase marketing and outreach 

develop and offer discipline-specific wrokshops
DM fundamentals for Socsci, humanities, etc. - working with liaison libraians 
assessment of program - to see how effective marketing and services 



### CARL Portage: The RDM journey continues...
#### Jeff Moon; Shahira Khair; Lee Wilson
##### Expert groups available:
DMP
curation
data discovery
Preservation
Training
Research Intelligence

##### Working groups:
dataverse
Responsible reseearch data management practices for sensitive data

* issues with sensitive data:
how to mange sensitive data

* stakeholder engagement:
regional provincial - 4 library consortia

* Development of tri-agecy RDM infratstruce and policy:
what do institutions need - 
institutional strategy - providing guidnace
DMPs - uses DMP Assistant tool - moving to DMP Roadmap (DMPTool)
tri-agency policy will encourage DMP creation 


* Deposit:
partner with other institutions
Dataverse North
FRDR - DFDR data repositories 

##### Federated RDM Architecture: Repository 
* Active storage:  
Raw data, unprocessed data, cloud storoate, OSF - messy data   

* Repository storage - accessible  
dataverse, regional - Dalhousie & Abicus - examples of dataverses  
FRDR DFDR - used for large datasets "big data" creates bags and transfer with Globus - good resouce as a national repo  
instit. repos - e.g. Islandora, dryad, zonodo  
discipline repos - e.g. genbank  

use resources for storing data with metadata, sharing and accessibility 

storage layers:

* national discovery layer 
* Preservation processing (under development) - narmalization of files, open format conversions 
e.g. archivematica, Ontario library consortia 


future planning:
* distributed netowrk of curation support services 
* build tools and services for "active" data curation 
* implement geospatial discovery layer for end user
* create single end-user facing platform

implementing a Single unified RDM service:
* simplified data life cycle 
before research project, during project, after, training and support

1 service question to think about for unified RDM services: where do you draw the line between data and compute?

trying to build a mature single level of service: standarizing different parts of the services.  
focus/target on disciplines or domains as much as possible 

Services:  
DMP - key component for the service, get people thinking ahead of serivce uses ahead of time, work with school to make a DMP requirement as a part of the curriculum 
software management planning - how to manage software sustainablity e.g. reporducing data at a software level   

Working with data:
developing secure sensitive data, iso22001, using github and gitlab - currently using subversion, get reseachers to use ELNs DATA SAFE HAVEN 

Data stewardship options/goals:
enhancing display 0- including multimedia
Data vault - GDPR - secure long-term storage
embrace new tech and metadata standards for curating and providing access to research images 
communication about complexity of open and closed options  
FAIR repository development 

Training and support:   
need new communication plan document    
annoynimization training for sensitive data   
periodic GDPR training   

challenges:   
getting through workload   
managing stakeholders expectations   
keep up with field of RDM    
rearching beyond early adopters   
getting people to think abour FAIR    
Scholarly publishing competition vs Open

### Optimizing data ingest: Experiences from ICPSR
#### Jared Lyle; Abay Israel; Justin Noble

metadata - finding the right balance and incentives to provide  

legal permisiions - do they have the authority to deposit content    
can you modify?   

ICPSR process - 2007 created online form    
simplify form - finding balance between information and length 
simplify steps to deposit -  lots of services make it a few steps to upload and describe data   

deposit workspace - went from form to workspace.  allows depositors to incrementally work on a submission as opposed to needing to upload and descripbe all files at once   

collaboration - users share projects with other collaborators and grant various permissions levels to these collaborators.  this allows for multiple researchers or PIs    

folder sturcture - projects needed flexibility to organize submissions in to folders    

file-level metadata - depositing materials.  researchers provide information 

project communication log - project log that allows for data depositor and ICPSR curators to send messages to each other.    

any file type can be imported/ingested.   

Deposit system improved other ICPSR tech.   
OpenICPSR, DataLumos - stored gov data for preservation, Census    
preview functionality on the study homepage    
help icons   
ICPSR metadata editor   

Internal and external feedback   
setup methods to receive user feedback, various audience and users

## Plenary 2: Dr. Stephanie Pyne (DB Clarke Auditorium, Hall Building)
#### Abstract
##### Cybercartography and Inclusion:  The Residential Schools Land Memory Mapping Project

Providing an inclusive space for many perspectives and encouraging people to express themselves in their own ways is a key ingredient of the kind of deliberative democracy envisioned in Inclusion and Democracy by Iris Marion Young, who recommended a broad approach to rationality that can accommodate alternative forms of communication such as greeting, rhetoric, and narrative.  Inclusion is also central to the critical cartographic view of the map as both a process and a narrative vehicle capable of reflecting multiple dimensions. The critical turn in cartography has led to a vast new range of possibilities for mediating reconciliation and social justice initiatives worldwide. Cybercartography is an evolving theoretical and practical framework for transdisciplinary collaborative projects to develop online interactive multimedia atlas websites intended to present multiple perspectives and dimensions of socioeconomic, political and cultural issues. Research began in 2007 on the prototype Cybercartographic Atlas of Indigenous Perspectives and Knowledge (Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region), which provided the basis for the five-year SSHRC-funded Lake Huron Treaty Atlas Project (2009-2014), and in turn led to the current five-year SSHRC-funded Residential Schools Land Memory Mapping Project (RSLMMP, 2015-2020). This discussion tracks the evolution of the RSLMMP with a focus on inclusivity, emergence and the transdisciplinary research relationships that have developed through this evolution.

### Biography
Dr. Stephanie Pyne is a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Carleton Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre. A multidisciplinary researcher with policy experience working with the Justice Department, Dr. Pyneâ€™s PhD work involved creating a cybercartographic atlas intended to shed light on the many dimensions of treaty relationships, including those under the Robinson Huron Treaty. In her current Post-Doctoral research assignment under the Residential Schools Land Memory Mapping Project (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight Grant, 2015-2020, PI, Dr. D.R. Fraser Taylor), she works with others in the Residential Schools reconciliation research and education community to expand the work undertaken in her doctoral and post-doctoral studies.
