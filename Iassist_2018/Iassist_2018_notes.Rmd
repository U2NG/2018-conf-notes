Abstract
Data Journalism: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Data Science and Storytelling

Data journalism is the marriage of social science and public-interest storytelling, using data as a source and employing reproducible analysis methods to arrive at a conclusion. This is a radical change from traditional ways of reporting, which often rely on anecdotes and paper documents. But despite being at its heart journalism, where crafting a gripping narrative is just as important as getting the facts right, data journalists haven't always been good at telling stories. This is changing, and we're entering a golden age of storytelling based on data and stats.

NICAR - nat. institute compute assisted reporting

# Road Maps for RDM Services, What Next?
#### Session Chair: Rachel Walton, Rollins College

### Scaling up RDM services at Duke University: Where we are now, what we have learned, and where we are going
#### Jennifer Darragh; Sophia Lafferty-Hess

looking at teams specifically for the repository development 
worked with liaison librarians - for presenting services to the greater community 

launched services in 2017 

RDM education: dev 12 unique workshops 
wroked with deam of academic affiars for grads - developed program all grads required to take 6 hours for credit 
challenge content cannot cover all disciplines
workshops e.g.
IRB
Research computing 

life cycle based services: based on environmental scanning
DMPs 
active project workflow management 
preservation and access services 

challenges:
distributed collaborative research - uses OSF for collaborative project solution 


repo services: 
moving to Fedora
preingest reveiw of data files 
streamlined deposit process - pre ingest process included 

what works:
DOis 
pre-publication review 
apply FAIR standards 
connections and collaborations with groups on campus e.g. events for DMP reviews DMPTool 
Data management education important - hearing about tools to use , challenge - don't know if practices are being followed 

marketing services continuously...

future processes:
increase marketing and outreach 

develop and offer discipline-specific wrokshops
DM fundamentals for Socsci, humanities, etc. - working with liaison libraians 
assessment of program - to see how effective marketing and services 




### CARL Portage: The RDM journey continues...
#### Jeff Moon; Shahira Khair; Lee Wilson
##### Expert groups available:
DMP
curation
data discovery
Preservation
Training
Research Intelligence

##### Working groups:
dataverse
Responsible reseearch data management practices for sensitive data

* issues with sensitive data:
how to mange sensitive data

* stakeholder engagement:
regional provincial - 4 library consortia

* Development of tri-agecy RDM infratstruce and policy:
what do institutions need - 
institutional strategy - providing guidnace
DMPs - uses DMP Assistant tool - moving to DMP Roadmap (DMPTool)
tri-agency policy will encourage DMP creation 


* Deposit:
partner with other institutions
Dataverse North
FRDR - DFDR data repositories 

##### Federated RDM Architecture: Repository 
* Active storage:  
Raw data, unprocessed data, cloud storoate, OSF - messy data   

* Repository storage - accessible  
dataverse, regional  
instit. repos - e.g. Islandora, dryad, zonodo  
discipline repos - e.g. genbank  

use resources for storing data with metadata, sharing and accessibility
