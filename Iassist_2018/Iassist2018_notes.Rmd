Abstract
Data Journalism: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Data Science and Storytelling

Data journalism is the marriage of social science and public-interest storytelling, using data as a source and employing reproducible analysis methods to arrive at a conclusion. This is a radical change from traditional ways of reporting, which often rely on anecdotes and paper documents. But despite being at its heart journalism, where crafting a gripping narrative is just as important as getting the facts right, data journalists haven't always been good at telling stories. This is changing, and we're entering a golden age of storytelling based on data and stats.
