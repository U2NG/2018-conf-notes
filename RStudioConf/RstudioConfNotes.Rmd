To the Tidyverse and Beyond: Challenges for the Future in Data Science 

visual inference protocol
p-hacking 
think about interactive graphics and inference procedures as part of the data pipeline

GG provides the fucntional mapping of variable to plot element that makes data plots become statistices that we can do inference on. wihc what

gutenberg

reticulate::use_python('python path', required = TRUE)



```{bash}
pwd
```

```{r}
getwd()
```


```{python}

print "Hello, Python"
```


### Branding and automating your work with R Markdown 
### Daniel Hadley

branding images 
Magick function - put gifs on top of plots 


---

weekly hours worked data averages artilce goverining.com
### Tidy eval: programming with dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2
### Hadley Wickham


tidy eval 
save typing and translate 

!! tidyverse can use to unquote

r code is a tree 
build tress by unquoting
 expr() captures your expression 
 exper() supports unqupting - simplifying expression 
 
capture user input by qupting 

enexpr() lets you wupte user expressios 

tidy eval lets you reduce duplication

R database interface DBI

quoting of identifiers and strings and literals 
distinction between queries and statements 



---

### Best practices for working with databases 
### Edgar Ruiz

packages:

dbplyr
dbplot - new package release - cretes histograms in ggplot object 
shinydashboard - creates dashboard
purrr
shiny
highcharacter
DT

### Machine Learning with R and TensorFlow 
### JJ Allaire

packages:
keras package
tfestimators
tensorflow
lime
tfruns
cloudml
tfdeploy





creator of the Rstudio IDE, Rmarkdown pckg
tendorflow OpSrc from google 
R interface with tensorflow
deep learning uses 

tensorflow - general purpose numerical computing library
developed by google brain team for conduction machine learning 

can run on :
CPU
GPU
TPU tensor processing unit - google dev. 

supports auto differentiation 
doesn't require all data in RAM 

tendorflow models can be deployed with a low latency C++

Tensorflow basics:
tensors - data stored in multidimiensional arrays 
e.g. tensor data- vector data, (iris) 
timeseries data or sequence data - observations overtime 
4d tensor- image data 

What is flow:
dataflow graph with n nodes representing units of computation 

tensorflow or dataflow graph is generated auto from R code 
graphs gain in performance, scalability, portability 

uses of Tensorflow:
tensorflow.rstudio.com/gallery

deep learning, machine learning 

E.g. Greta project 
greta-dev.github.io/greta  - writing stat models 

deeplearning - input and putput via layers of representation 
data transformation functions parameterized by weights 
layer geometric transformaiton function on the data 
taking data - transoformations to get out close to output 

transformain ginput data into useful representations

layers of representation in a deep learning model -feature transformations are learned 

deep learning - multiple layers of representation 

other namesL 
layered represntaitons learning 
hierarchical representation of learning 

deep learning examples:
autonomous cars
human-speech level recog. 

R uses for deep learning 
does deep learning improve current R processes e.g. improving modeling 
is deep learning applicable 

how to train deep learning:
machine learning algorithms 
learning model parameters via exposure to many example data points 
eval. model and tweak it over time 

stat modeling vs. machine learning 
stats - 
machine - prediciting future data 

papers written about deep learning:
VGG millions of parameters - for computer vision 
computer vision
dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2999257

arxiv.org/abs/1708.02709

time series 
ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7870510

biomedical applications 
paper

electronic health records (EHR)
arxiv.org/abs/1801.07860

problems with deep learning:
not easily interpreted 
brittle, adversarial examples 
requires large amount of data to performwel

computationally expensive to train 

deep learning hype makes things worse
will be trolled by bad deep learning models 


keras api - promoted by google for interfacing with tensorflow, used a lot in research 
pre-process
model 
compile model
model tarining 


GPU processing
tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/gpu

deploying models:
tensorflow serving - google

takeaways:
tensorflow is a new gen purpose numerical computing library

deep leaerning has made great progress 

R has a great set of apis for using tensorflow

### Teach the Tidyverse to beginners 
### David Robinson
varianceexplained.org

packages:
Fs- file system 

why teach the tidyverse

good way for students to understand thier data

datacamp - intro to the tidyverse 
data wrangline 
data viz - bring in as early as possible 
grouping summarizing 
types of viz 

case studies
data cleaning and summ with dplyr
ggplote
tidy with broom 
joining and tidy

tidy shows results immediately 
consistency in interface with functions 

what is the trade off for teaching the tidyverse:
topics taught later 
data sturctures 
loops
conditionals 
user-defined functions 

R for Data Sci book - recommendation and good example of why to teach later
those topics are covered later in - chapters 19 & 21 

have goals for what you want your students to do, and have them do it as early as possible 

talk about things students want to do 
tach abstract concepts and how they are applied 

book - text ming with R 

datacamp data driven curriculum development
